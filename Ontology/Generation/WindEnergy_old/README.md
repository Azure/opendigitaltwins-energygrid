## Wind Energy
Wind energy or wind power is the process of generating electricity with the help of wind. Wind Turbines harness the kinetic energy of winds and used to generate mechanical energy which in turn converts into electrical energy.

### **Wind Farms** 
Wind farms are the dedicated area of land, where a large number of wind turbines are installed for generating electricity. 

### **Wind Turbines**
Wind Turbine is a power generating device, which converts kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electricity and send to the grid. It is one of the most efficient way to convert wind energy into mechanical energy.

### **Nacelle** 
The Nacelle is nothing but the housing of generator, gearbox, braking system, shafts etc. It is a lightweight box made from glass fiber. It connects the tower to the rotor.

## **Yaw System**
Yawning is the movement of the turbine along the vertical axis. Yaw mechanism consists of the yaw motor. Yaw mechanism orients turbines to move according to the wind direction and speed. It is a part of upwind turbines only. 

## **Electrical generator**
The generator converts rotational motion into electrical energy. The electrical generators used in turbines are either asynchronous generators or induction generators.

## **Weather Sensors**
As you know anemometer is used to measure the speed of the wind. And wind vane tells us the direction of the wind. Of course, this is an important part for controlling the turbines automatically.

## **Gearbox**
The gearbox transforms the low shaft speed (30-60 rpm) into faster speed (about 1000-1800 rpm). This speed is necessary to drive the electrical generator.
